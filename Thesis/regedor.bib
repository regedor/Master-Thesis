  abstract = {There is an increasing demand for software that matches real user
	needs in a working environment. The paper describes the new
	
	framework for software product quality developed for ISO/IEC 9126-1:
	internal quality (static properties of the code), external
	
	quality (behaviour of the software when it is executed) and quality
	in use (the extent to which the software meets the needs of the
	
	user). Quality in use is a broader view of the ergonomic concept of
	usability in ISO 9241-11 (1998). Achieving quality in use requires
	
	a user-centred design process which has cultural, strategic and technical
	implications. Ã“ 1999 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights re-

	During this period, algorithms and techniques for source-code analysis

	The abilities of the tools that implement them have also expanded
	to meet new and diverse challenges. 
	
	
	This paper surveys current work on source-code analysis. 
	
	
	It also provides a road map for future work over the next five-year

	applications, techniques, and challenges over the next 10, 20, and
